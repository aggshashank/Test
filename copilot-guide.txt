Example Experience and Prompt Sharing
Engineer Name: Jane Doe

Date: 2024-06-30

Project/Module: User Authentication Service

Use Case Category: Code Generation

Description:
Needed to generate a new endpoint for user login with JWT authentication.

Effective Prompt:

plaintext
Copy code
// Create an endpoint for user login that returns a JWT token
Output Provided by Copilot:

python
Copy code
@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    username = request.json.get('username')
    password = request.json.get('password')
    user = User.query.filter_by(username=username).first()
    if user and check_password_hash(user.password, password):
        token = jwt.encode({'id': user.id}, app.config['SECRET_KEY'])
        return jsonify({'token': token})
    return jsonify({'message': 'Invalid credentials'}), 401
Evaluation:

Accuracy: 5
Efficiency: 5
Usefulness: 5
Comments:
The prompt generated a fully functional login endpoint that only required minor adjustments. It saved significant development time.

Introduction to Git
Git is a version control system that allows multiple people to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes. It also provides a historical record of your projectâ€™s evolution.

Key Concepts
Repository (Repo): A directory which contains your project files and the history of changes made to them.
Commit: A snapshot of your project files at a specific point in time.
Branch: A separate line of development in your project.
Merge: The process of integrating changes from one branch into another.
Remote Repository: A repository hosted on the internet or network.
Installation
Windows: Download from git-scm.com.
macOS: Install via Homebrew (brew install git) or download from git-scm.com.
Linux: Install via package manager (sudo apt-get install git for Debian/Ubuntu, sudo yum install git for Fedora).
Basic Commands
Configuration

bash
Copy code
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
Creating a Repository

bash
Copy code
mkdir myproject
cd myproject
git init
Cloning a Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
Checking Status

bash
Copy code
git status
Adding Changes

bash
Copy code
git add filename
git add .
Committing Changes

bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Commit message"
Pushing Changes

bash
Copy code
git push origin branch-name
Pulling Changes

bash
Copy code
git pull origin branch-name
Working with Branches
Creating a New Branch

bash
Copy code
git checkout -b new-branch
Switching Branches

bash
Copy code
git checkout branch-name
Merging Branches

bash
Copy code
git checkout main
git merge branch-name
Resolving Conflicts
Open conflicted files and look for markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>).
Edit the file to resolve the conflict.
Add and commit the resolved changes.
Undoing Changes
Unstaging a File

bash
Copy code
git reset HEAD filename
Discarding Local Changes

bash
Copy code
git checkout -- filename
Reverting a Commit

bash
Copy code
git revert commit-id
Working with Remote Repositories
Adding a Remote

bash
Copy code
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git
Viewing Remotes

bash
Copy code
git remote -v
Removing a Remote

bash
Copy code
git remote rm origin
Advanced Concepts
Stashing Changes

bash
Copy code
git stash
git stash apply
Rebasing

bash
Copy code
git rebase branch-name
Tagging

bash
Copy code
git tag v1.0
git push origin v1.0
Best Practices
Commit Often: Make small, frequent commits with meaningful messages.
Use Branches: Keep your main branch clean and use feature branches.
Pull Before Pushing: Always pull the latest changes before pushing.
Review Code: Use pull requests for code reviews.
